<!--
    In html ; you cant see excactly the effects of span and div; 
    but  they surround the parts you have created inside them;
     After javascript and styling CSS  ; we can create effect on them;
     
     that (div) is container for group of elements
     and (span) is container to a part of element/text in the webpage

     (span) is only taking its specified space ; it don't take a whole line to be separated;
     so it is called inline element.

     (div) takes a complete block/line from the webpage;
      so it is called block element.
